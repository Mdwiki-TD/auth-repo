# Authentication System

## Overview
This project is an authentication system implemented in PHP. It manages user authentication tasks such as login, logout, callbacks (potentially for OAuth), and user data management.

## System Components
The project consists of three main components:

### 1. Auth Module – Core Authentication Endpoints
This module contains the core authentication logic and API endpoints.
- **Files:**
  - `auth/login.php` – Handles user login requests.
  - `auth/logout.php` – Manages user logout functionality.
  - `auth/callback.php` – Handles authentication callbacks (e.g., OAuth responses).
  - `auth/get_user.php`, `auth/user_infos.php` – Fetch user information.
  - `auth/index.php`, `auth/edit.php`, `auth/u.php` – Provides user-related interactions.
  - `auth/api.php`, `auth/access_helps.php`, `auth/helps.php`, `auth/send_edit.php` – Additional API endpoints.
  - `auth/mdwiki_sql.php` – Potential SQL interactions for user authentication.

### 2. Configuration & Dependencies
Manages system configuration and external dependencies.
- **Files:**
  - `auth/config.php` – Contains system-wide configuration settings (e.g., database connections, credentials).
  - `composer.json` – Defines PHP dependencies managed via Composer.
  - `vendor_load.php` – Loads external libraries for authentication handling.

### 3. Presentation Layer (User Interface)
Represents the front-end components that interact with the authentication system.
- **Files:**
  - `index.php` – Main entry point for user interactions.
  - `view.php` – User-facing views for authentication and related actions.

## System Design
The authentication system follows a modular architecture:
- **Client Interaction:** Users interact via `index.php` and `view.php`, which send authentication requests to the Auth Module.
- **Authentication Workflow:**
  - `login.php` initiates authentication.
  - `callback.php` processes third-party authentication responses.
  - `get_user.php` and `user_infos.php` retrieve user data.
  - `logout.php` handles session termination.
- **Configuration & Dependencies:** `config.php` supplies settings, while `composer.json` and `vendor_load.php` manage dependencies.
- **(Optional) Database Integration:** If user data persistence is needed, `mdwiki_sql.php` may facilitate database interactions.

## Data Flow
1. **User Requests:**
   - Client (browser) requests authentication via `index.php` or `view.php`.
   - Requests are forwarded to authentication endpoints in `auth/`.
2. **Authentication Processing:**
   - Login and authentication responses are handled in `login.php` and `callback.php`.
   - User data retrieval occurs via `get_user.php` and `user_infos.php`.
3. **Logout & Session Management:**
   - `logout.php` manages user logout operations.
4. **Configuration & Initialization:**
   - `config.php` provides necessary configurations.
   - Dependencies are loaded via `composer.json` and `vendor_load.php`.
5. **Optional Database Interactions:**
   - `mdwiki_sql.php` may be used for authentication-related SQL operations.

## Architectural Considerations
- **Separation of Concerns:** The system divides logic into authentication processing, user interactions, and configuration.
- **Modular Design:** Each PHP file serves a distinct function, allowing flexibility and maintainability.
- **Dependency Management:** Uses Composer for handling external dependencies.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
3. Configure the system:
   - Edit `auth/config.php` with appropriate settings.
4. Deploy the application on a PHP-compatible web server.

## Usage
- API endpoints in `auth/` can be used for authentication and user data management.
